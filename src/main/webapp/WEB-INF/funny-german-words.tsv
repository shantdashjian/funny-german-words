Ohrwurm	Ear worm	Have you ever listened to a song on the radio while driving to work only to find yourself still humming the same tune by lunch time? Congratulations, you’ve had an ear worm. The beautiful German word Ohrwurm describes the fact of having a song stuck in your head as if it wriggled itself into your brain through your ear.	http://www.suedkurier.de/storage/image/9/6/7/3/7383769_storagepic-frame-945x560_1oEGpO_DVfhK7.jpg
Fernweh	Distance pain	This gem describes the feeling of wanting to be somewhere else. It’s kind of like a reverse homesickness (Heimweh in German), a longing for a place that isn’t where you are right now. Fernweh is also a frequent reason for people in Germany to go on holiday. 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flughafen_Berlin-Tempelhof_bei_Sonnenuntergang_-_Fernweh_%28152672327%29.jpg/1920px-Flughafen_Berlin-Tempelhof_bei_Sonnenuntergang_-_Fernweh_%28152672327%29.jpg
Kummerspeck	Grief bacon	When a relationship ends or during other times of sadness, anger, or worry, it’s common to put on a few pounds of Kummerspeck. What it means is the excess weight put on by emotional overeating. So when you find yourself on the couch watching “Bridget Jones’ Diary” with a tub of ice cream, you are in fact feeding your grief bacon.	https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6067/6057404732_f7169a6664_z.jpg
Innerer Schweinehund	Inner pig dog	Can’t get up in the morning to be on time for work? Too lazy to go to the gym? Homework remains undone until the last minute? Don’t worry, it’s not your fault. The blame lies with your inner pig dog. That’s the tiny voice in the back of your head which is trying to convince you to live a life of inertia and which you will have to overcome to rid yourself of Kummerspeck.	http://www.brunorennt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brunorennt_innerer-schweinehund.jpg
Fremdschämen	Exterior shame	For those of you who cringe in phantom pain when others make a fool of themselves, this is your word. It describes the feeling of shame when seeing someone else in an uncomfortable or embarrassing situation. It’s a real thing for the more empathetic folk and has kept more than one person from watching “the Office.” 	http://thenextjew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iWKad22r-300x225.jpg
Torschlusspanik	Closing-gate panic	As people get older, some find themselves worrying about roads not taken or milestones they meant to achieve by a certain age but haven’t. Torschlusspanik is the feeling of urgency to accomplish them before some imaginary gate closes and “it’s all too late.” It’s mostly used for those who sense their biological clock is running out and feel the need to settle with a partner or have children immediately.	http://www.dw.com/image/17136413_303.jpg
